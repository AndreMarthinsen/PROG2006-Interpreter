# PROG2006 - Interpreter

## Description
This is one of two assignments in the course Advanced Programming at NTNU Gj√∏vik. The assignment was to implement an interpreter of a high level 
scripting langauge with syntax and functionality not too dissimilar from the functional programming language Haskell, along with a CLI tool allowing
interacting with the language through declaring variables, inputting lines of code and using commands to get information about types and function signatures.
